Hands up who studied waterfall at some point in their education? And who of you thought to question it at the time (no-one believes you) when you first learned about it? We didn't because at the time, it was perfectly normal. Waterfall was normal, code first was normal. Sure there was discussion around techniques but the vast majority of companies struggled on.

It's impossible to say whether companies struggle more with Agile today than they did with waterfall... but it doesn't seem like it. I sometimes have to take a step back and realise that actually Agile is still not 'normal'. Maybe that's for the best but that's not what this article is about. What I'd like to know it, how long does a technology or process take to become fully mainstream, to a point where we take it for granted and hardly know it's there?

Perhaps I need to explain myself a little better when I talk about something being 'normal'. Email is something that has become normal, but as recently as 10 years ago was not. When something becomes normal we stop questioning it, we are intimately aware of it's pros and cons but are happy with the results we're seeing at least for now. Brushing your teeth is normal but electric toothbrushes - although common - are not yet normal. They are still a bit of a novelty and many people don't see them as necessary.

The key here is the part where people stop questioning. No that's not right... it's vitally important that we question things once in a while but when we are finally happy with our trade-offs and stop thinking about them and trying to reason about them and invent new ones - then finally something could be said to have become normal.

With waterfall it never stopped being normal... we didn't discover anything revolutionary about it or anything terrible we didn't already know, but the position of comparison changed when we had something better to compare it to, and so the balance of pro's and con's shifted(?). 

Agile on the other hand should have been normal a long time ago. But it's still this enigma, it's still this big thing that's going to solve all your companies problems. It's up there on a golden pedestal as the ultimate solution. We in the community are perpetuating this scenario, even if we don't mean to.

We're locked in a vicious cycle where everyone is interpreting Agile slightly differently, so it never gets a chance to settle down and become a baseline that we can compare against in order to determine the next step forward. If we're not careful we're going to end up comparing every new thing against Waterfall instead, as it's (ironically) stable - and we're never going to move forward. We'll have been going sideways for the better part of a decade. 

It's not just Agile that suffers from being put up on a pedestal. Microservices, TDD, Domain driven design, Functional Programming. Hell even our good old friend OOP is still misunderstood - what become normal there ended up being a diluted, mangled form. 

But the fact of the matter is we keep these things at arms length because there's a risk involved. Instead of looking at the pros and cons, learning to accept the trade-offs and apply them in the appropriate situations we put them on their pedestal, admire their glory from the far, speaking, blogging and writing about how shiny they are and how amazing we are for using them... and this is the very essence of the problem.

Things will not become normal until we start *treating them as normal*. Lets take functional programming off it's pedestal. Lets stop preaching that Agile is going to change the world. Lets stop debating the optimal size of a microservice (as if that's important) instead of simply stating the facts. 

Instead of all these things, blog about them as if they're as usual and as mundane as brushing your teeth. Focus on the facts and not the evangelism, stop giving big fancy names to things and eventually this calm feeling, this *normal* feeling will filter down from the community to the wider software development world and we can all get on with our lives.

Yes we must always question things - I will argue this point until I am blue in the face - but we need a solid baseline for comparison so we can measure our success and ensure we are moving forwards not sideways. It's time for a new normal, and believe me it's long overdue.
