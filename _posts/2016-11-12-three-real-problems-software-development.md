I recently debuted a new talk entitled "The Three Real Problems in Software Development" at the Øredev conference in Malmö, Sweden. It's a fantastic conference which you should definitely try and attend (or even speak at) if you get the chance!

You can watch the video <a href="/blog/three-real-problems-software-development#player">here</a>, and be sure to check out the many other great talks which can all be found on the <a href="https://vimeo.com/user4280938">Øredev Vimeo page</a>. You can find out more about this amazing conference at <a href="http://oredev.org">oredev.org</a>.

#### About this talk

Coding is fun and rewarding, but sadly we need more than just programming skills in order to build great software and deliver value to our customers. Software is a people industry, and we have to get to grips with collaborative design, select the best architecture, processes and tools, and then convince others that our approach is correct. Where's the stack overflow for that!?

Fortunately, many problems you'll encounter in your career in software boil down to just a handful of core concepts from which many solid strategies can be derived. This talk will cover three of these that I consider most important, things I wish I'd known years ago. You'll learn ways to help guide your team on their journey to building better software, and more importantly identify when your way may not be best after all (!)
